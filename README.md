Using Service Accounts for uploading to avoid user rate limit
For Service Account to work, you must set USE_SERVICE_ACCOUNTS="True" in config file or environment variables, Many thanks to AutoRClone for the scripts. NOTE: Using Service Accounts is only recommended while uploading to a Team Drive.

Generate Service Accounts. What is Service Account

Add all the Service Accounts to the Team Drive
Run:
python3 add_to_team_drive.py -d SharedTeamDriveSrcID
Youtube-dl authentication using .netrc file
For using your premium accounts in Youtube-dl or for protected Index Links, edit the netrc file according to following format:

machine host login username password my_youtube_password
For Index Link with only password without username, even http auth will not work, so this is the solution.

machine example.workers.dev password index_password
Where host is the name of extractor (eg. Youtube, Twitch). Multiple accounts of different hosts can be added each separated by a new line.
